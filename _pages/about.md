I am Oluwole Olobatuyi, a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Alberta. My research interests are in the 
fields of mathematical biology and data science.

Mathematical models include ordinary differential equations and nonlinear partial differential equations. A significant part of my research involves the formulation and verification of quantitative models, in collaboration with biologists. My Ph.D. project focuses on modeling cellular responses to low doses of ionizing radiation, which include post-radiation cellular communications via signal emission and propagation; and radiation-induced hypersensitivity. Mathematical approaches include analytical methods for dynamical systems, asymptotic analysis, and computational methods.

My expertise in statistical modeling and machine learning include generalized linear models, and nonlinear models like neural net, Bayesian net, support vector machines, and classification and regression analysis. Biological problems in the last five years include statistical ecology, population dynamic models, analysis and inference, and metabolic and body composition data. Software includes R package, MATLAB, Tableau, Mathematica, Java, C, and Python. 

Research summary:
Ionizing radiations are widely used in the treatment of more than 50% of cancer and various medical scans. Although cellular response to ionizing radiation (IR) is well studied, the vast majority of these studies were done at higher doses; and there is no consensus regarding the effects of low doses on cells. Deadly effects like carcinogenesis, hyper-radiosensitivity, and cancer invasions are common effects of exposures to low doses on cells. Earlier models that studied these responses were limited to a class of individual-based and phenomenological models. While these classes of models can be useful, they are not amenable to mathematical analysis and their statistical data analysis requires extremely high computational complexities. These make the analysis of steady state solutions of such models impossible. The importance of steady states is that these are the effects observed in cells and tissues (e.g., cell invasion and carcinogenesis).

I formulate and analyze a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) model for the radiation-induced bystander effect, which is one of the cellular event that leads the phenomenon of low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity. This model incorporate bystander effects like cell death, DNA damage, and DNA repair delay. Questions we attempt to answer include: 
* How does the persistence or extinction of the bystander signals, which cause the bystander effects, depend on the nature of irradiated cells? 
* How does the invasion speed of the signals depend on the nature of both the irradiated and the surrounding un-irradiated cells? 
* What is the effect of bystander signals on the invasion speed of irradiated cells vis-a-vis the surrounding un-irradiated cells?

I also formulate a system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) for the G2-checkpoint dynamics, which is a cell cycle-based events that lead to the low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity phenomenon. This model incorporates cell cycle dynamics and the G2-checkpoint events like the mitotic catastrophe, DNA damage, and the activation dynamics of the G2-checkpoint. Questions we attempt to answer include: 
* How does the HRS phenomenon depend on the cell cycle events involved in the G2-checkpoint dynamics? 
* What is the connection between the magnitude of HRS in a cell and its resistance to radiation dose of 2Gy?
