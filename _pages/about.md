I am Oluwole Olobatuyi, a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Alberta. My research interests are in the 
fields of mathematical biology and data science.

Mathematical models include ordinary differential equations and nonlinear partial differential equations. A significant part of my research involves the formulation and verification of quantitative models, in collaboration with biologists. My Ph.D. project focuses on modeling cellular responses to low doses of ionizing radiation, which include post-radiation cellular communications via signal emission and propagation; and radiation-induced hypersensitivity. Mathematical approaches include analytical methods for dynamical systems, asymptotic analysis, and computational methods.

My expertise in statistical modeling and machine learning include generalized linear models, and nonlinear models like neural net, Bayesian net, support vector machines, and classification and regression analysis. Biological problems in the last five years include statistical ecology, population dynamic models, analysis and inference, and metabolic and body composition data. Software includes R package, MATLAB, Tableau, Mathematica, Java, C, and Python. 

My primary research work focuses on formulating and analyzing stoichiometry based biodegradation models. Questions I attempt to answer include:
* What mechanisms allow microbes and  resources  to persist uniformly or go extinct?
* How do the grazers affect decomposition?
* How can the rate of decomposition be maximized or minimized?
* What are the impacts of important factors such as temperature, priming effect, and inhibitory effect of excess  organic matter on the decomposition rate?

Additionally, I develop and analyze  stoichiometry based models for  the dynamics of phytoplankton  in a stratified lake. These models  incorporate the  dependence of phytoplankton production on light and cellular nutrient contents.  The main objectives here are twofold:
* firstly, to examine how the key features of a stratified lake, such as the depths of epilimnion and hypolimnion, nutrient and light availability, affect the persistence, extinction and biodiversity of algae and bacteria in a stratified lake and
* secondly to dicuss how human activities, such as nearby agriculture or industrial pollution, cause harmful algal blooms in a stratified lake.

I also have a vested interest in diseases dynamics, which is growing rapidly. The current focus is on  formulating and analyzing directly and indirectly  transmitted infectious disease model among homogenous populations as well as heterogeneous populations.  Questions aim to answer include:
* Why are there irregularities in seasonal patterns of outbreaks amongst different countries?
* How  can we estimate the transmission   function of an infectious disease  from a given incidence or prevalence data set?
* What is the estimated value of the basic reproduction number in affected regions?
